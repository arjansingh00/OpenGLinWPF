## Overview

#### This project is based upon this [CodeProject tutorial](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/23736/Creating-OpenGL-Windows-in-WPF) and the code provided.

I have rebuilt the program using the same source code (with a few modifications) using a C++ CLR Class Library, because the original project from 2009 did not render on my computer. I use the compiled DLL in the C# WPF project.
The code currently retains the formatting from the original project, which can be slightly confusing, inconsistent, and redundant in places.
